VGSLite is a R based helper application built to support VGS 5 Desktop on Windows devices.

## Installation

To install [VGSLite](https://github.com/tgilbert14/VGSLite) on your Windows device:

1.  Download the latest release from [**VGSLite**](https://github.com/tgilbert14/VGSLite/releases).
2.  Unzip the folder (if needed) and install the latest `VGSLite Setup.exe`.
3.  You may have to click "*more info*" in order to install the application.

## Features

-   ✅ **Check for var and sub species:** Checks for variety and subspecies being used. These are often entered by mistake. This allows the user to download a list of species of interest being used.

-   ✅ **Clean Database:** Cleans up any orphan data links that may exist to help prevent corrupt data. Often used before "Empty Tombstone" to troubleshoot sync issues.

-   ✅ **Convert database to Local:** Moves cloud data into local folders. **NOT** recommended unless you plan on only collecting data locally.

-   ✅ **Delete Unassigned data:** Deletes all data and sites inside the "Unassigned" bin at once instead of going though each event.

-   ✅ **Empty Tombstone:** Clears deletion cache, often used to troubleshoot sync issues.

-   ✅ **Move Event:** Lets user move a single event from an existing site to another site. Often used when an event was put on the wrong site. This will not update sync states *(i.e., cloud-to-local or local-to-cloud).*

-   ✅ **Update Species (Frequency/DWR):** Lets user update a species in every instance it occurs for frequency and DWR methods for all data downloaded onto VGS5 device*.* Provides a downloadable csv file to track updates and checks for possible issues with updates.
